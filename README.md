# A Book Tracking App

The project was started from a template from Udacity's React Fundamentals course. It provided a static example of the CSS and HTML markup that may be used, but without any of the React code that is needed to complete the project. I started with the template, and added interactivity to the app by refactoring the static code in the template.

## How to use the app

* Clone or download this repository to you computer,
* Install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* Start the development server with `npm start`

## A Bout the App

The app runs in a browser once you starts the server.Users are able to interact with books that are group in three main shelves;

* Currently Reading,
* Want to Read, and
* Read

They are then able to move the books into the various shellves base on a read book,a book to be read and what is read now!
Incase a book of no interest is found by a user, a serach for any book can be done by navigating to a search page.An input of a search text will produces book title,authors and cover images of the search results. From the results,a book can be added to any shelf of interest.
